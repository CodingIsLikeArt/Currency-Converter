# Currency-Converter
This is a currency converter web-application. It is made to convert a certain amount from a currency to another. After you choose the amount that you want to convert and the currencies you will get the converted value.

### Developement
The application is written in **Python** (using **Django** for the back-end), **HTML** ,**CSS** and **Bootstrap** (for the front-end). To convert the currencies we have used a API. _Note that the project is still in developement._

### The Plan
1. The main part :
    * ~~Making a User-Interface~~ .
    * Dealing with the API .
    * Working with the back-end .
2. Further plans:
    * Making it more responsive for mobile devices.
     * Changing the design .

### Contributions 
After the main part has been finished everyone that wants to contribute can give his ideas and write them in the **Further plans** section .
